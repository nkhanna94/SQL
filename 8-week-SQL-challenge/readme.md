# 8WeekSQLChallenge

This repository contains my solutions to the **8WeekSQLChallenge**, created by [Danny Ma](https://twitter.com/dannyma21), aimed at enhancing my SQL skills and applying them to real-world case studies. Each folder corresponds to a challenge from the series.

## About the Challenge

The **8WeekSQLChallenge** is designed to improve SQL querying skills by solving progressively more complex problems using databases. By completing this challenge, I aim to deepen my understanding of SQL, data analysis, and query optimization.

You can check out the challenge and participate [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/).
